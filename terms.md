Terms of Service for Canvas Sync

Last Updated: 1/17/2026

1. Acceptance of Terms

By installing and using the "Canvas Sync" Google Workspace Add-on ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use the Service.

2. Description of Service

Canvas Sync is a productivity tool designed to synchronize assignment data from the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS) to Google Tasks. The Service parses calendar feed data provided by the user and creates corresponding tasks in the user's Google Tasks account.

3. User Data and Privacy

We take your privacy seriously.

No External Database: The Service does not transmit your data to any third-party servers controlled by the developer. All processing happens within the Google Apps Script environment attached to your Google Account.

Data Storage: The Service stores your Canvas Calendar Feed URL and configuration settings (e.g., auto-sync status, last sync time) locally in your Google account's "User Properties."

Data Usage: The Service only accesses the data necessary to perform its function: reading your Canvas Calendar feed and writing to your Google Tasks.

Credentials: We do not have access to your Canvas login credentials. The Service relies solely on the public/private ICS feed URL you provide.

4. User Responsibilities

Accuracy: You are responsible for providing a valid and correct Canvas Calendar Feed URL.

Security: You are responsible for keeping your Calendar Feed URL secure. If you believe your feed URL has been compromised, you should reset it within your Canvas settings and update the Service.

Usage: You agree not to use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Service.

5. Third-Party Services

The Service interacts with third-party services:

Canvas LMS (Instructure): To fetch assignment data.

Google Tasks: To create tasks.
Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. We are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of data provided by Canvas.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT IT WILL SYNC EVERY ASSIGNMENT PERFECTLY. YOU USE THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DEVELOPER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

8. Modifications to Service and Terms

We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service at any time, with or without notice. We may also update these Terms of Service from time to time. Your continued use of the Service after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
