Privacy Policy for Canvas Sync

Last Updated: 1/17/2026

1. Introduction

Canvas Sync ("we," "us," or "our") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Google Workspace Add-on.

In Short: We do not store your personal data on our own servers. The application runs entirely within your Google account infrastructure, processing data directly between Canvas and Google Tasks.

2. Information We Collect

A. Information You Provide

Canvas Calendar Feed URL: We collect the .ics link you paste into the application settings. This is stored locally in your Google account's "User Properties" storage.

Configuration Settings: We store your preferences, such as whether "Auto-Sync" is enabled and the timestamp of your last synchronization.

B. Information Accessed via Google APIs

To function, the application accesses the following data through Google APIs, based on the permissions you grant:

Google Tasks: The app reads your task lists to prevent duplicates and writes new tasks based on your assignments.

External Services (Canvas): The app fetches data from the Canvas URL you provided.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely for the purpose of providing the Service:

To Synchronize Data: We use your Canvas Feed URL to fetch assignment details (title, due date, description) and create corresponding tasks in Google Tasks.

To Maintain Functionality: We use your configuration settings to run automatic background syncs (if enabled) and display status updates in the UI.

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.

4. Data Storage and Security

No External Servers: We do not operate a backend server or database for this application. Your data is not transmitted to the developer.

Local Processing: All data processing occurs within Google's secure Apps Script environment, which is governed by Google's security standards.

Data Retention: Your Canvas URL is retained in your Google account properties until you remove the add-on or explicitly reset your settings within the add-on sidebar.

5. Third-Party Services

This application acts as a bridge between two third-party services. Your data is subject to the privacy policies of these providers:

Google: Google Privacy Policy

Instructure (Canvas): Instructure Privacy Policy

6. Limited Use Policy (Google API Services)

Canvas Sync's use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

7. Your Rights

Since we do not store your data on external servers, you have full control:

Access & Correction: You can view and update your Canvas Feed URL at any time via the add-on settings.

Deletion: You can delete your stored data by clicking "Edit Link" -> "Disconnect" in the add-on, or by uninstalling the add-on from your Google Workspace account.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
