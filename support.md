Support for Canvas Sync

Welcome to the support page for Canvas Sync. This add-on is designed to help you automatically synchronize your Canvas LMS assignments to your Google Tasks.

🚀 Getting Started

Install the Add-on: Install Canvas Sync from the Google Workspace Marketplace.

Open the Sidebar: Click the Canvas Sync icon (Blue Checkmark) in the right-hand side panel of Google Calendar.

Get your Link: Go to Canvas > Calendar > click "Calendar Feed" (bottom right) > Copy the URL.

Connect: Paste the URL into the add-on sidebar and click "Connect Account."

Sync: Click "Sync Now" to fetch your assignments.

🔧 Troubleshooting

"Quota Exceeded" or "Rate Limit" Errors

Google imposes strict limits on how fast tasks can be created. If you have a lot of assignments (e.g., at the start of a semester), the add-on may hit this limit.

Solution: The add-on handles this automatically by pausing. If it stops, simply click "Sync Now" again to pick up where it left off.

"Exceeded Maximum Execution Time"

Scripts can only run for 30 seconds. If you have hundreds of past assignments, the script might time out.

Solution: The add-on is optimized to sync the most recent 30 days first. If it times out, it will save its progress. Click "Sync Now" again to finish the batch.

"Invalid URL" Error

Solution: Ensure you are copying the Calendar Feed link (which ends in .ics), not the URL from your browser's address bar.

Assignments appearing on the wrong day?

Solution: Canvas exports times in UTC. The add-on automatically adjusts for this, but if your specific Canvas instance uses a strange timezone setting, please contact support with details.
